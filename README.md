**Setup:**

1. Install the SDK: `pip install google-generativeai`
2. Obtain an API key from Google AI Studio.
3. Configure the SDK with your API key.

**Usage:**

* List available models.
* Generate text from text and image inputs.
* Have multi-turn conversations with Gemini.
* Generate embeddings for text.

**Advanced use cases:**

* Configure safety settings.
* Encode messages for lower-level API access.
* Manage multi-turn conversations manually.
* Modify generation parameters.
